# Scenario 003: Interoceptive Blind-Spot & Acute Gastric Distress

## I. Metadata (Feature Engineering Tags)
| Feature | Value | Research Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Trigger** | Acute Interoceptive Pain | Gastric distress ("Sore tummy"). |
| **Secondary Trigger** | Sensory Isolation | 60min unmonitored room stay (Data Gap). |
| **Regulatory Input** | Chemical Regulation | Medication administered @ 01:00. |
| **Cognitive State** | Rapid Re-attachment | Immediate remorse/apology ("Sorry"). |
| **Temporal Window** | 45 Minutes | 00:45 - 01:30. |
| **Sampling Rate** | 1Hz | Trend analysis focused on "Sudden-Onset" spikes. |

## II. Clinical Narrative 

### Phase 1: The Observational Gap (23:45 - 00:45)
The individual was in their private space for 60 minutes. While coded as "relaxing," the lack of outward behavioral markers created a **Blind-Spot**. Retrospective analysis suggests a slow accumulation of interoceptive signals (gastric cramping) that failed to reach the threshold of communication until the peak.

### Phase 2: Acute Discharge (00:45 - 00:50)
The individual exited the room in a high-velocity state (running). A singular **Proprioceptive Strike** (headbutt) occurred. 
* **Affective Computing Insight:** This is classified as **Pain-Induced Affective Discharge** rather than intentional aggression. The sudden transition from isolation to the lounge suggests a desperate search for a co-regulatory anchor.

### Phase 3: Post-Ictal Relational Repair (00:50 - 01:00)
Immediately following the discharge, the individual sat on the sofa and repeated "Sorry." This indicates that the **Cognitive Bypass** was brief. The individual’s identity recognition and relational mapping remained intact, allowing for immediate verbal reporting of the "sore tummy."

### Phase 4: Chemical & Environmental Regulation (01:00 - 01:30)
Staff provided medical intervention. The presence of the staff (Relational Anchor) and the pharmacological lead-in allowed for a decrease in sympathetic arousal. 

### Phase 5: Terminal Stabilization (01:30+)
The individual returned to their room and achieved a state of rest. No further arousal spikes were recorded for the duration of the shift.

## III. Research Directions 
* **The "Silent" Lead-up:** How can NAMS model the *absence* of data as a risk factor? (e.g., Is 60 minutes of "quiet" a predictor for interoceptive spikes?).
* **Synthetic Modeling:** Simulate a 40% increase in **Vagal Tone** volatility 15 minutes prior to the 00:45 exit to see if a TCN can flag the "Internal Pressure" threshold.
