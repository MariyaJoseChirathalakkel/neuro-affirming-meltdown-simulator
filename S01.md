## 📝 Anonymous Narrative

### Phase 1: Initial State & Failed Regulation
*   **05:25:** Early waking. Individual attempted to return to rest but reported persistent insomnia. 
*   **05:35:** Initial digital media intervention (music imagery) provided only transient (10-minute) regulation before dysregulation resumed.

### Phase 2: Escalation & Sensory Redirection
*   **06:10:** Transition to communal space resulted in heightened distress, manifested as physical seeking behavior (nipping) and verbal perseveration regarding sleep disruption.
*   **06:15 (Intervention 1):** Redirection to high-proprioceptive "Heavy Work" (stair climbing, laundry folding) provided 45 minutes of behavioral stability.

### Phase 3: The Primary Trigger (Relational Discontinuity)
*   **06:45:** Individual identified the absence of a preferred support figure. The shift to a non-preferred staff member triggered acute dysregulation. 
*   **Symptoms:** Pacing, running, and temporary cognitive distortion (difficulty recognizing the preferred figure upon their return), followed by environmental discharge (throwing objects).

### Phase 4: De-escalation & Resolution
*   **07:15:** Transition to a private bedroom environment was initiated. 
*   **Intervention 2:** Stabilization was achieved through a **High-Interest Cognitive Bypass** (special interest: sports conversation), redirecting focus from the relational stressor.
*   **07:35 (Resolution):** Full behavioral and physiological baseline recovery achieved.

## 💡 Researcher Insight (MSc AI Perspective)
Observation S-01 demonstrates that "Heavy Work" (proprioception) can provide temporary stability, but it may not address the underlying **relational stressor**. The transition from "Physical Redirection" to "Cognitive Bypass" (Special Interest) proved to be the only successful method for full baseline resolution. 

**Research Goal:** This case proves the need for **Multimodal Context** in Affective Computing. A wearable device would see high arousal during both the "Stair Climbing" (Regulation) and "Throwing Objects" (Crisis) phases. My research aims to distinguish between **Regulatory Arousal** and **Dysregulated Arousal** by analyzing environmental and relational metadata.
