# Scenario 001: Relational Discontinuity & Metabolic Debt

## I. Metadata (Feature Engineering Tags)
| Feature | Value | Research Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Trigger** | Relational Discontinuity | Absence of "Anchor" staff. |
| **Secondary Trigger** | Metabolic Debt | Sleep deprivation (Wake @ 05:25). |
| **Regulatory Input** | Proprioceptive Transition | Laundry/Stairs (Heavy Work). |
| **Cognitive State** | Cognitive Bypass | Loss of object permanence/identity recognition. |
| **Temporal Window** | 130 Minutes | 05:25 - 07:35. |
| **Sampling Rate** | 1Hz | Trend analysis for "Slow-Burn" detection. |

## II. Narrative (Clinical Reframing)

### Phase 1: Circadian Phase Shift (05:25 - 05:40)
The individual experienced a premature arousal from sleep. Initial self-regulation was attempted via a **Special Interest (SpI)** digital stimulus (iPad/Music Band). Despite the digital anchor, the individual was unable to achieve a return to sleep, resulting in an immediate accumulation of **Metabolic Debt**.

### Phase 2: Autonomic Instability (05:40 - 05:45)
A rapid escalation in arousal was noted, manifesting as physical nipping. This is interpreted not as aggression, but as a **Sensory Seeking** response to internal distress and temporal confusion (asking "why" he was awake). 

### Phase 3: The False Baseline (05:45 - 06:30)
Staff implemented **Proprioceptive Redirection** (folding laundry, climbing stairs). 
* **Observation:** The individual appeared "calm." 
* **Affective Computing Insight:** This was a **False Baseline**. While the physical activity down-regulated the sympathetic nervous system, the underlying metabolic vulnerability remained high.

### Phase 4: Relational Discontinuity & Peak Distress (06:30 - 06:45)
The removal of a specific relational "Anchor" (staff member leaving the lounge) triggered a **Cognitive Bypass**. The individual entered a state of high-arousal panic, characterized by:
* Running (Flight response).
* Environmental discharge (Throwing items).
* **Temporary Prosopagnosia:** Upon the staff member's return, the individual's high-arousal state inhibited facial/identity recognition, extending the distress duration.

### Phase 5: Co-Regulatory Recovery (06:45 - 07:35)
Recovery was achieved through a 10-minute relational repair (verbal reassurance) followed by a shift to a high-interest cognitive task (Sports). Full autonomic stabilization (Vagal Tone recovery) was confirmed at 07:35.

## III. Research Directions (2026 Focus)
* **Predictive Window:** Can the TCN identify the "False Baseline" at 06:00 to predict the 06:30 crash?
* **Vagal Tone Analysis:** Model the 20Hz HRV drop during the "Staff Missing" window.
