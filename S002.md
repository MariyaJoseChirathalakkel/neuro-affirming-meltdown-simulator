## II. Clinical Narrative 

### Phase 1: Pre-Trigger Baseline (00:00 - 01:00)
The individual was initially in a state of rest (in bed). Physiological data indicates a stable nocturnal baseline. However, the subsequent arousal at 01:00 suggests a **Circadian Phase Shift** or an internal sensory search for a specific item (the t-shirt).

### Phase 2: Searching & Environmental Disruption (01:00 - 01:05)
The individual exited the room holding a t-shirt and began a disorganized search of the cupboard. This resulted in total displacement of contents—a behavioral marker of **Proprioceptive Seeking** or disorganized executive processing during low-arousal states.

### Phase 3: The High-Load Task (01:05 - 01:35)
Staff directed the individual to tidy the cupboard. 
* **Observation:** While not physically strenuous, the task was observed to be **mentally challenging** and induced visible stress. 
* **Affective Computing Insight:** This represents a **Cognitive Bypass**. The individual’s nervous system was forced into a high-arousal state to meet the executive demands of categorization and sequencing at a time of peak metabolic vulnerability. 



### Phase 4: Executive Exhaustion (01:35 - 02:00)
Following the 30-minute task, the individual appeared visibly tired—a state of **post-demand depletion**. The transition back to bed was immediate, but the heart rate likely remained elevated (Tachycardia proxy) for a period as the sympathetic nervous system slowly down-regulated.

### Phase 5: Delayed Regulation & Sleep (02:00)
Full autonomic stabilization and sleep onset were achieved by 02:00, exactly 60 minutes after the initial arousal. The "Slow-Burn" recovery period was longer than the task itself.

## III. Research Directions 
* **Metabolic Debt Projection:** How does this 30-minute high-EF (Executive Function) window at 01:00 affect the **Vagal Tone** baseline for the following afternoon shift?
* **Task Demand Modeling:** Contrast Scenario 001 (Physical Heavy Work) with Scenario 002 (Cognitive Sorting) to determine which creates a steeper drop in HRV.
* **TCN Implementation:** Can the Temporal Convolutional Network detect the subtle HR rise *before* the cupboard was emptied?
